## Structure

clippizo uses a monorepo structure managed by Turborepo:

```
clippizo/
├── apps/           # Deployable applications
│   ├── web/        # Marketing website (port 3001)
│   ├── app/        # Main application (port 3000)

└── packages/       # Shared packages
    ├── design-system/
    ├── database/
    ├── auth/
    └── ...
```

Each app is self-contained and independently deployable. Packages are shared across apps for consistency and maintainability.
